## Usage

### Starting the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

The home screen presents two tools: **Database Editor** and **Startlist Generator**, plus a list of recently opened CDB files. Click a recent file to jump straight into editing.

---

### Database Editor

#### Opening a Database

1. Click the **Database Editor** tile on the home screen, or click a recent file
2. Select a `.cdb` file from the file dialog
3. The app converts it to SQLite internally and loads all tables

#### Browsing Tables

- The **sidebar** lists all tables in the database
- Type in the sidebar search box to filter tables by name
- **Favorites**: Right-click a table and select "Add to Favorites" to pin it at the top. Drag and drop to reorder favorites

#### Editing Data

- **Double-click** any cell (including ID columns) to start editing
- **Enter**: Commit the edit and move to the cell below
- **Tab / Shift+Tab**: Move to the next / previous cell
- **Arrow Up / Down**: Move to the cell above / below
- **Escape**: Cancel the edit
- Type a new value and press Enter to save it to the database

#### Lookup Mode

Toggle **Lookup: ON/OFF** in the toolbar to switch between raw IDs and human-readable names for foreign key columns.

- When **ON**: FK columns display resolved names (e.g. team names, rider names instead of numeric IDs). Searching also matches against these display names.
- When **OFF**: FK columns display raw ID values
- Single-click an FK cell in lookup mode to open a dropdown with all valid options

#### Search

The search box in the toolbar filters the current table in real-time:
- Searches across **all columns** simultaneously
- In lookup mode, also matches FK display values (e.g. search "Jumbo" to find riders by team name)
- Clear the search with the X button

#### Sorting

- Click any **column header** to sort ascending
- Click again to sort **descending**
- Sorting persists until you switch tables

#### Row Operations

- **Add Row**: Click the "Add Row" button in the toolbar to insert a new row
- **Duplicate Row**: Right-click a row (or multi-select rows) and choose "Duplicate Row"
- **Delete Row**: Right-click and choose "Delete Row"
- **Multi-select**: Hold Ctrl or Shift and click rows, or press Ctrl+A to select all

#### Column Management

- **Hide columns**: Right-click a column header and select "Hide Column"
- **Manage columns**: Use the Tools menu > "Manage Columns" to open the column visibility dialog
  - Check/uncheck columns to show or hide them
  - Save column visibility configurations as **presets** for reuse
  - Use "Show All" / "Hide All" for bulk toggling

#### Undo / Redo

- **Ctrl+Z**: Undo the last cell edit
- **Ctrl+Y**: Redo
- The undo/redo buttons in the toolbar also work

#### CSV Import / Export

From the **Tools** menu:
- **Export Table to CSV**: Save the current table as a CSV file
- **Import CSV to Table**: Load data from a CSV file into the current table
- **Export All Tables**: Export every table in the database to individual CSV files in a folder
- **Import All Tables**: Import CSVs from a folder, matching filenames to table names

#### Saving Changes

- Click **Save As...** in the toolbar to convert the modified SQLite database back to a `.cdb` file
- The app will prompt for an output path -- you can overwrite the original or save to a new file
- **Always keep a backup of your original `.cdb` file**

---

### Startlist Generator

The startlist generator has two tabs: **Singleplayer** (HTML to XML) and **Multiplayer** (HTML + CDB to modified CDB).

#### Singleplayer: HTML to XML Startlist

Use this to generate a PCM-compatible XML startlist file from a saved HTML page.

**Preparing the HTML file:**
1. Go to the startlist page on [FirstCycling](https://firstcycling.com) or [ProCyclingStats](https://www.procyclingstats.com)
2. Right-click anywhere on the page and select **"Save as..."** (or press Ctrl+S)
3. In the save dialog, set "Save as type" to **"Webpage, HTML Only"**
4. Save the `.html` file somewhere you can find it, then browse to it in the app

**Step-by-step:**

1. Click the **Startlist Generator** tile from the home screen
2. **Select a database** for ID matching:
   - Pick a CSV database from the dropdown (databases stored in the `databases/` folder), OR
   - Click **Open CDB...** to load a `.cdb` file directly
3. The database status will confirm how many teams and cyclists were loaded
4. Click **Browse...** to select an HTML startlist file saved from [FirstCycling](https://firstcycling.com) or [ProCyclingStats](https://www.procyclingstats.com)
5. **Select a race** from the dropdown -- this determines the output XML filename. The race list is populated from the database's `STA_race` table
6. Click **Generate Startlist**
7. The log will show the matching progress: which teams and riders were matched to database IDs, and which were not found
8. The output XML file is saved to the working directory

#### Multiplayer: CDB Startlist Modification

Use this to create a modified CDB where teams are trimmed to their race startlist. Non-startlist riders are moved to the free agent pool (team 119).

**How it works:**
- For teams **with riders in the HTML startlist**: keeps all matched riders.
- Removed riders have their `fkIDteam` set to 119 (free agent) and their contracts deleted

**Step-by-step:**

1. Go to the **Multiplayer** tab in the Startlist Generator
2. Click **Load CDB...** to select and convert your `.cdb` database
3. Click **Browse...** to select the HTML startlist file
4. Click **Save as...** to choose the output `.cdb` file path
5. Click **Generate CDB Startlist**
6. A backup reminder will appear -- make sure you have a copy of your original CDB
7. The log shows the matching process:
   - `[TEAM] Team Name -> ID 123` for matched teams
   - `[RIDER] Rider Name -> ID 456` for matched riders
   - `-> NOT FOUND` for unmatched entries
8. After matching, the app modifies the database and exports the result as a new `.cdb` file
9. A summary dialog shows how many riders were kept and how many were moved to team 119

**Tip:** The output CDB is a new file -- your original database is never modified.

## Configuration

The application automatically creates `session_config.json` to store:
- Window size and maximized state
- Favorite tables
- Recent file paths
- Last opened directory
- Lookup mode preference

This file is gitignored and will be created on first run.

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m unittest discover tests

# Run a specific test module
python -m unittest tests.test_app_state
```

## Contributing

1. Follow existing code style and patterns
2. Test changes on actual PCM CDB files
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Update documentation for new features

## Known Limitations

- **Windows Only**: Requires SQLiteExporter.exe which is Windows-specific
- **CDB Format**: Supports PCM game CDB files only
- **Large Files**: Very large databases may take time to convert and load

## Troubleshooting

**"Module tkinter not found"**
Tkinter is included with Python on Windows. Reinstall Python ensuring "tcl/tk and IDLE" is selected.

**"SQLiteExporter.exe not found"**
Ensure the `SQLiteExporter/` folder is in the same directory as `main.py`.

**CDB file won't open**
Ensure the file is a valid PCM CDB file and not corrupted.
